Design Document for SR5HomebrewCharacterManager User Interface
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The goal of this UI is to provide a simple, scalable, and intuitive platform through which the user can interact with the program.

I. Startup
The UI should display a splash screen, with a dialog box that asks the user which reasource files they wish to load.
The UI should be able to send instructions to load these files, and have a simple "Load All" option.

II. Asset Creation
The UI should provide a toolset for creating characters and other assets.
The UI should prompt the user for which archive file to use when creating assets, have the option to create a new archive, and 
have the capibility to switch the active archive at any time.
There should be intuitive aides for character creation, along the lines of those found in Shadowrun, 5th ed.
The user should be guided along a path to character creation, but able to skip around if they like.
Adding and removing items/qualities/gear from the character should cause relevant stats to update.

III. Character Management
There should be a graphical character sheet that displays relevant information to the user.
There should be automated attack, skill, etc. checks available via buttons near the appropriate skill/weapon.
The user should be easily able to add misc. modifiers to these checks.
A damage chart should be available.
Adding/removing items, gear, etc. should work as in character creation.
Adding karma, money, etc. should be simple and intuitive.

IV. Asthetic
The UI should be able to display stored images, but not in such a way that unnecessarily clutters the UI.
The UI shouldn't look like butts.
